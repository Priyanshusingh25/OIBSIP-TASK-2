            <p id="img-caption">Messi relocated to Spain from Argentina aged 13 to join Barcelona, for whom he made his competitive debut aged 17 in October 2004. He established himself as an integral player for the club within the next three years, and in his first uninterrupted
                season in 2008–09 he helped Barcelona achieve the first treble in Spanish football; that year, aged 22, Messi won his first Ballon d'Or. Three successful seasons followed, with Messi winning four consecutive Ballons d'Or, making him the
                first player to win the award four times. During the 2011–12 season, he set the La Liga and European records for most goals scored in a single season, while establishing himself as Barcelona's all-time top scorer. The following two seasons,
                Messi finished second for the Ballon d'Or behind Cristiano Ronaldo (his perceived career rival), before regaining his best form during the 2014–15 campaign, becoming the all-time top scorer in La Liga and leading Barcelona to a historic
                second treble, after which he was awarded a fifth Ballon d'Or in 2015. Messi assumed captaincy of Barcelona in 2018, and won a record sixth Ballon d'Or in 2019. Out of contract, he signed for Paris Saint-Germain in August 2021.

            <h3>Childhood and Early Life :</h3>
            <p>Messi was born on 24 June 1987 in Rosario, Santa Fe,[9] the third of four children of Jorge Messi, a steel factory manager, and his wife Celia Cuccittini, who worked in a magnet manufacturing workshop. On his father's side, he is of Italian
                and Spanish descent, the great-grandson of immigrants from the north-central Adriatic Marche region of Italy, and on his mother's side, he has primarily Italian ancestry.[4] Growing up in a tight-knit, football-loving family, "Leo" developed
                a passion for the sport from an early age, playing constantly with his older brothers, Rodrigo and Matías, and his cousins, Maximiliano and Emanuel Biancucchi, both of whom became professional footballers

            <h3>Early Career :</h3>
            <p>2003–2005: Rise to the first team "It seemed as if he had been playing with us all his life." – Barcelona's then assistant coach Henk ten Cate on Messi's first-team debut.[29] During the 2003–04 season, his fourth with Barcelona, Messi rapidly
                progressed through the club's ranks, debuting for a record five youth teams in a single campaign.[30] After being named player of the tournament in four international pre-season competitions with the Juveniles B, he played only one official
                match with the team before being promoted to the Juveniles A, where he scored 18 goals in 11 league games. 2005–2008: Becoming a starting eleven player "In my entire life I have never seen a player of such quality and personality at such
                a young age, particularly wearing the 'heavy' shirt of one of the world's great clubs." – Fabio Capello praises the 18-year-old Messi following the Joan Gamper trophy in August 2005.[47] On 24 June, his 18th birthday, Messi signed his
                first contract as a senior team player. It made him a Barcelona player until 2010, two years less than his previous contract, but his buyout clause increased to €150 million.[40] His breakthrough came two months later, on 24 August, during
                the Joan Gamper Trophy, Barcelona's pre-season competition.

            <h3>Lionel Messi personal life :</h3>
            <p>Since 2008, Messi has been in a relationship with Antonela Roccuzzo, a fellow native of Rosario. Messi and Roccuzzo have three sons: Thiago (born 2012), Mateo (born 2015) and Ciro (born 2018). Messi enjoys a close relationship with his immediate
                family members, particularly his mother, Celia, whose face he has tattooed on his left shoulder. His professional affairs are largely run as a family business: his father, Jorge, has been his agent since he was 14, and his oldest brother,
                Rodrigo, handles his daily schedule and publicity. His mother and other brother, Matías, manage his charitable organization, the Leo Messi Foundation, and take care of personal and professional matters in Rosario.
